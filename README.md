# hello-world

Hey everyone,

My name is Brandon, and I have zero coding experience. A general dissatisfaction with my current work has pushed me to start exploring other options. Coding is something that has recently struck my interest. After doing some reading and watching some yotube videos I found myself here. I look forward to jumping into this new experience and learning more about it. Glad to see there is a huge community I can hopefully pick some people's brains and learn from.

Here goes nothing...
